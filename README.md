## Code Explanation

The code is structured into several functions that perform different trading operations. Here is a brief explanation of each function:

- `IdentifyTrendLines`: This function identifies and draws trend lines based on the user-defined period and deviation parameters.
- `DetectSupportResistance`: This function detects support and resistance levels in the market and marks them on the chart.
- `ExecuteBuyOrders`: This function executes buy orders when the price breaks above a trend line or support level.
- `ExecuteSellOrders`: This function executes sell orders when the price breaks below a trend line or resistance level.
- `CalculateStopLoss`: This function automatically calculates and places stop-loss orders based on predefined parameters.
- `CalculateTakeProfit`: This function automatically calculates and places take-profit orders based on predefined parameters.
- `MonitorMarket`: This function monitors the market in real-time and updates trend lines, support, and resistance levels.
- `GenerateTradeAlerts`: This function generates trade alerts or notifications when a buy or sell order is executed.
- `TrackPerformance`: This function tracks and displays the performance of executed trades, including profit/loss calculations.
- `CustomizeParameters`: This function allows users to customize and adjust the parameters according to their preferences.
- `HandleErrors`: This function handles errors and exceptions during the execution of trades and provides appropriate error messages or notifications to the user.

The program execution starts with the `OnInit` function, where necessary components and variables are initialized. The trading operations are then performed by calling the respective functions. The `OnTick` function contains the program's execution logic, and the `OnDeinit` function is responsible for cleaning up resources and performing necessary actions before program termination.
